#### :sunny: Unit 7 Home Truths

- **Understanding the Text**

:zap: **part a**

1. When British people say, “My home is my castle”, what do they mean?

A castle is a very strong building specifically built to keep the people inside safe and secure. The expression, therefore, means that the home is a place where the owner feels safe from the outside world and where the outside world cannot enter without his permission. He is protected and secure there. This is a very common expression used to describe the attitude of English people towards their homes. It may also link with ideas about privacy: many British people like to think of their home as being a private place which others can’t simply just walk into without permission; inside the family they can do as they wish, without being bothered by outsiders.

2. what are the two main reasons why British people like spending lots of money on their homes?

One reason is that the house costs so much to buy that it makes good sense to maintain it and even improve it as much as possible (both to make it worth even more if it is sold and to improve the comfort and space if not). The other reason is that the home is, in a way, a reflection of the owner. How the house looks to other people, tells them something about the person who owns it — therefore the owner wants to make sure it reflects a good image. The better the houses look, the better the owners feel about their status.

3. what is a mortgage?

It is a loan from a bank or other financial company that is used specifically to buy a house. It is paid back through monthly payments (with interest) over a number of years — often over as many as 25 years.

4. What impact did the Industrial Revolution have on people’s ideas about homes?

Before the Industrial Revolution, the home was much more than simply a house that you happened to be living in at that time. It had a history of family life, of ancestors, of relatives and probably of having the same neighbours for generations. After the Industrial Revolution, people had to move around much more and the home became more of a place that you were living in at that time and many of the other traditions were lost.

5.what is trading up?

Trading up means buying a house that is relatively cheap, keeping it for a few years until its value has increased (and also the owners’ assets), and then selling it to buy a more expensive property. This process is repeated several times over, each property being more expensive than the one before. Trading up only works in times of inflation or progressive increases in property values; if prices were stable over many years, trading up would be unlikely to happen much.

​    Much of the vocabulary used to describe aspects of fashion has negative connotations. Examples are: “fashion victim”, “slaves to fashion”, “vicious circle”, “sense of inferiority”, “vulnerable”.

​    The writer emphasizes: the wasted clothes caused by changes in fashion; the high cost of fashions; the way fashion houses deliberately change fashions to make more money; the huge profits made by fashion houses; the dreadful conditions in some “sweatshops”; the very low wages in the clothes manufacturing industry. 

​    The writer also criticizes people who follow fashions closely, saying they lack self-confidence, have a low self-esteem, etc.

| The major claim is that, because young people generally lack a strong sense of self-confidence, they need other people to regularly reassure them that they are special or look good. This means that they are more likely to become slaves to the ever-changing fashions of the time. | There are no fixed answers, but you should be able to give good, logical reasons for your opinions. |

Generally speaking, all of the above arguments need to be supported by statistical evidence. Specific figures which show prices, wages, profits etc. need to be given. Photographs or films showing the fashion industry in action, or perhaps interview comments from workers in the fashion industry would probably make the arguments seem more convincing. But the arguments are still very general and would then only be illustrated by specific cases. Really, the arguments need some kind of numerical or statistical data. For example, at the end of the text there is a claim that fashion houses make “huge profits” but how would we know this? It would be more convincing if the writer had quoted some figures to show these huge profits. Even then, there may be other fashion houses which do not make huge profits so perhaps the writer really needs to quote some figures of average profits.
